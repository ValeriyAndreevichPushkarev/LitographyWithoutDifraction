# LitographyWithoutDifraction
Litography based on coherence

Why you don't use holographic lithography?
You will get interference only in places where two coherent beams intersect each other. (Yes, down to atom i guess)

Lloyd's mirror for example. 

You will see no interference in places where you don't have direct and refracted rays.

You can control interference with optical path length. (To make a mask)

And you don't have any diffraction at all.

Space can be limited down to several atoms.

Note that space of coherence not limited with wavelength(and L/4).
