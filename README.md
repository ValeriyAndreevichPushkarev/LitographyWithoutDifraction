# LitographyWithoutDifraction
Litography based on coherence

Why you don't use holographic lithography?
You will get interference only in places where two coherent beams intersect each other. (Yes, down to atom i guess)

Lloyd's mirror for example. Or you can use biprism.

You will see no interference in places where you don't have direct and refracted rays.

You can control interference with optical path length. (To make a mask on biprism/LLoyd\s mirror)

And you don't have any diffraction at all.

Space can be limited down to several atoms. (size of the resulted elements, not positioning elements within 2 nm)

Note that space of coherence not limited with wavelength(and L/4).

And you can change optical path length(and phase) with different materials.
